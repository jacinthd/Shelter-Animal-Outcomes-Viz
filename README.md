## Shelter Animal Outcomes

This are the visualizations I made in D3 and Matplotlib for shelter-animal-outcomes for my visualization class project

Original Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes

train.csv in this repo has derived columns for visualization

The D3 folder has the code for the dashboard that was presented
The Matplotlib plots were made to showcase charts that wouldn't be as effective as the charts shown in the dashboard
